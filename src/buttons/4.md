## Ensuring Accessible Contrast for Buttons

There are many ways to check contrast, including right in Chrome, Edge, and Firefox! Start by inspecting any text element, then locating the `color` property and selecting the color swatch which will open an additional panel. The browser will display the contrast ratio by detecting the computed `background-color` or `background-image` behind the element.

You can also keep scrolling to the [ButtonBuddy generator](#generator) to check your existing palette or explore creating a new palette that meets all the contrast vectors for buttons!

Important to note is that you can choose alternate methods to indicate `:focus` on a button instead of changing the `background-color`. [Review the upcoming WCAG 2.2 draft success criteria for focus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-appearance-minimum.html) to help determine what's best for interactive elements across your site or application. Using ButtonBuddy will help prepare you to meet WCAG 2.2 focus requirements.
