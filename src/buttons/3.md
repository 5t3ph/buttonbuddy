## Contrast Requirements for Buttons

Since buttons are interactive elements, we need to be concerned about contrast across states. The critical states are the default appearance and the focus state.

In the default state, we have the following levels of contrast:

- **Button Background vs. Text**: 4.5:1, or 3:1 for large text\*
- **Button Background vs. Surface**: 3.1 minimum, including over images and gradients

In the **focus state**, we have these same requirements, plus one additional if you choose to only rely on the `background-color`. In this case, we need to be sure that the **focus background color** has at least a 3:1 contrast change from the _default_ background color.
