## What is accessible contrast?

The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) determine [accessible contrast](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#visual-audio-contrast) and provide a ratio system to be able to check contrast consistently and programmatically.

We're frequently most concerned about contrast in the following categories: text and [user interface components](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html). Buttons count as a user interface component, whether they are really `<button>` elements, or links _styled as_ buttons ([learn the difference](https://marcysutton.com/links-vs-buttons-in-modern-web-applications)).
