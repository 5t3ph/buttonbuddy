## What is accessible contrast?

The Web Content Accessibilty Guidelines (WCAG) determine accessible contrast, and provide a ratio system to be able to check contrast consistently and programatically.

We're typically most concerned with two categories of contrast: text and graphical user interfaces. Buttons count as a graphical interface, whether they are really `<button>` elements, or links _styled as_ buttons ([learn the difference](https://marcysutton.com/links-vs-buttons-in-modern-web-applications)).
