<h3>Credits</h3>
<p>Many thanks to Jeff Escalante for the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/color-contrast">color-contrast package</a> which is calculating ratios for the contrasting colors. The base Eleventy project is borrowing from Michelle Barker's <a href="https://github.com/mbarker84/eleventy-parcel">eleventy-parcel</a> starter to enable JS bundling.</p>
